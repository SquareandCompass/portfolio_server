# Client 
- [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/coderwine/profile_client)

# WORKING ON:
- Projects Controller
- Need to build out email responses after clients have sent a message / other responses.
- MVP is set for v.1
- Need to structure how to handle images.
- AWS S3 connection
  - NOTE: Think I will need to come back to image upload after I start building out the frontend. 
    - Currently able to generate that URL and save it within the DB - however the file structure still needs the PUT method to store within the bucket.
